        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When spring arrives and asparagus are in season, they are hard to resist, right? Those green soldiers salute us as we enter the produce section of the market, challenging us to make good use of them while we can!</p>
        <p>Here is a fresh and easy asparagus soup that makes delicious use of our seasonal asparagus. The base is just onions, a little garlic, lots of chopped asparagus, broth (either chicken or veg), and chopped fresh parsley.</p>
        <p>We blanch the pretty asparagus tips separately so we can add them at the end as a pretty garnish to the pur√©ed soup. You can blanch the tips while the soup is cooking, so there's no added time.</p>
        <p>We are stirring in cream (I like to use sour cream), but if you are traveling light, you can skip it. A little cream stirred in at the end helps give the soup a creamy texture.</p>
        <p>What really gives the soup that special something is the addition of a little vermouth at the end. Sometimes it's hard to find in the market, but if you have some, use it!</p>
