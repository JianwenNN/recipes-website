        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ricotta cheese adds a creamy richness to these pancakes without making them dense, and lemon brightens the batter. Whip the egg whites separately for an extra-fluffy stack! Perfect for a special weekend brunch, Mother's Day, or Father's Day.</p>
        <p>Lemon and ricotta are a match made in heaven. You will find the pairing in many Italian desserts like cheesecakes, tarts, and torta di mandorle (lemon, ricotta, and almond cake), but with pancakes, you don’t have to wait until after dinner to enjoy this winning combination.</p>
        <p>Unless, of course, you are “a pancakes-for-supper” kind of gal like me. There’s nothing like pancakes to help make the stresses of just living in this world feel a little bit lighter.</p>
        <p>Ricotta adds richness without making the pancakes heavy or dense, and lemon adds a perky flavor that dances in your mouth when you take the first bite.</p>
        <p>While the step of separating the eggs and beating the whites by themselves does take a little extra time, this is about quality of life, people! The beaten egg whites lend an extra lightness to these delicately flavored pancakes. Make them for a special occasion, and enjoy the process.</p>
        <p>Because of the beaten egg whites, the batter of these pancakes is both thick and light. Once you drop a ladleful onto the hot pan, spread it out with the back of the spoon to make a smooth circle of batter that is about five inches wide. Serve them with the usual suspects (a.k.a butter and real maple syrup) and a spoonful of fresh berries.</p>
